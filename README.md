Docubricks viewer
===========================

Docubricks Viewer is a local [docubricks](http://docubricks.com/) test server for deveoping high quality Open Science Hardware documentations. It can also pack javascript for your docubricks site.

### Usage
Docubricks Viewer is requires node.js and npm, as well as a number of javascript packages such as React and Webpack:

Once you have cloned Docubricks Viewer move into the WebContent directory and run

```
$ npm install
```

This will locally install all of the packages you need into the node_modules folder. If you want to you could also install packages in the ``package.json`` file globally


#### Start local Docubricks Viewer server
```
$ npm start

```

If you want to run from a global install you can find the command ``npm start`` runs in the ``package.json`` file.

After starting the development server, go to http://localhost:8080/viewertest-xml-github.html to view the OpenFlexure Microscope documentation as an example.  You can view any DocuBricks project that can be retrieved via HTTP requests by specifying its URL in the ``docubricks_xml_url`` ``<div>`` element (in ``viewertest-xml-github.html``).  Security restrictions mean the JavaScript code that renders documentation can't access files on your hard drive - so the easiest way to view files you have locally is to place them in the ``WebContent`` folder in the "project" directory.


#### Build/Bundle

To build the javascript viewerbundle file for use on our own site you can simply run:
```
$ npm run-script bundle
```
again to get the command this script runs you can look into the ``package.json`` file.

### Deploying and using
Using this viewer on your GitHub project is simple; first, switch to your ``gh_pages`` branch, then copy the ``css`` folder, ``viewerbundle.js``, ``node_modules/react``, ``node_modules/react_dom``, and one of the HTML files into a folder in the repository.  Set the URL to point to the raw version of your XML file (i.e. the address you get when you click the "raw" link on GitHub).  Now, when you visit that HTML page, you should see your documentation nicely rendered.  The OpenFlexure Microscope is an example of this - see the [docubricks folder there](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/tree/gh-pages/docubricks) for details.
